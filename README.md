## Penshoppe Clone Website
-


Created the site from scratch using my stack knowledge and gained a new feature that I like, which is snap scroll. I love the effect; also, I like the aesthetics of the site with full cover images that attract the audience of the site. Big fan of these kinds of websites. I know that these websites can be easily built, but I love the small features they offer even though they are not that noticeable.
